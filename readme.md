A simple imperative language implementation.

The language is designed to be simple while being exposed to several interesting topics such as:

- Multiple level expression derivation rules as well as possibility to define custom operators
- A simple type system and type inference and potentially some genericity
- Some advanced topics on functions such as closures and HOF
- Ranges, tuples, arrays, ...

Current status:

- [x] Lexer with enhanced features.
- [x] Parser to generate AST for simple expressions.
- [ ] Doing: Custom operators
